This app is a tool for analyzing Bluetooth (BLE) environments. Scans the BLE ether in the background, notifying you if the device you are looking for is nearby or if some unknown device has been following you for for a long time.

The app allows you to create flexible filters for the radar with logical operators. Able to distinguish manufacturers, explore Apple Airdrop packages, and match them with known contacts. Build a device movement map based on the scanned BLE ether around you. For example, you can search for devices that you have seen in a certain period of time, receive a notification if your lost headphones suddenly appear near you.

In general, the app is capable:
* Scan, analyze and track Bluetooth devices around;
* Create flexible filters for the radar;
* Deep analysis of the scanned BLE devices, getting data from the available GATT services;
* Gatt services Explorer;
* Define the device type by metadata;
* Define approximate distance to the device.

This application does not share your personal data or geolocation, all work is offline.
