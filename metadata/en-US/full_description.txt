Bluetooth Radar in the background scans and analyzes Bluetooth Low Energy devices around you (eg smartwatches, headphones, speakers) and allows you to set complex rules to search for devices by specified filters. For example, by device name, address, location and time of discovery, manufacturer, and if an unknown device has been chasing you for a long time. Can be used to find your missing devices, or notify you if the device that you are looking for is nearby.

In general, the app is capable:
* Scan, analyze and track Bluetooth devices around;
* Create flexible filters for the radar;
* Deep analysis of the scanned BLE devices, getting data from the available GATT services;
* Gatt services Explorer;
* Define the device type by metadata;
* Define approximate distance to the device.

Bluetooth Radar does not collect or send your personal or geolocation data. The project is fully opensource and available on GitHub.
